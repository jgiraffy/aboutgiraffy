      whyP1: "In a world of \"compare and save,\" it's surprisingly hard to see the truth.",
      whyP2: "Across telecoms, banking, finance (loans), and insurance, you're often asked to make big financial decisions while only seeing half the picture. Prices are unclear. Fine print is buried. Most comparison sites are \"pay to play,\" prioritising providers who pay them commission rather than those offering the best option for you.",
      whyP3Bold: "Giraffy was built to change that.",
      whyP3: " We believe that seeing the full market is the only way to build real trust. We bring 100% of live household finance deals together, so you can compare fairly, avoid surprises, and switch with confidence.",

        question: "How is Giraffy different from other comparison sites?",
        answer: "Most comparison sites only show providers they have a commercial deal with in a \"pay to play\" model. Giraffy is built differently. We use our own Giraffy Radar technology to scan and show the entire market regardless of whether a provider pays us. Our goal is completeness over commission.",

        question: "How do you make money if you show every deal?",
        answer: "Transparency is our priority. Unlike other platforms, we do not receive referral fees or commissions when you switch providers. We primarily make money by selling our market intelligence software, Giraffy Intelligence, to telecoms, banks and insurers. We also occasionally feature sponsored ads at the top of the page.

      },
      {
        question: "Do you show deals from every bank and provider?",

          date: "21 February 2026",
          location: "London, United Kingdom",
          content: "Giraffy has officially launched in the United Kingdom, expanding its financial intelligence infrastructure into one of the world's most mature and competitive financial ecosystems.\n\nFollowing successful expansion across the GCC and recent launches in mainland Europe, the UK deployment demonstrates the robustness of Giraffy's structured market intelligence model in advanced regulatory environments.\n\n\"Household finance markets differ in regulation, but the structural inefficiency is universal,\" said Jason Lea, Co-founder & CEO of Giraffy. \"Consumers face fragmented comparisons. Companies lack neutral market-wide visibility. AI systems rely on incomplete financial data. The UK launch proves our model operates in highly competitive markets.\"\n\nGiraffy tracks live deals, pricing changes, and provider movements across telecoms, banking, insurance, and financing categories. The consumer platform captures high-intent comparison signals, which feed into Giraffy Intelligence, the company's enterprise-grade market intelligence product.\n\nThe UK launch strengthens Giraffy's European footprint and accelerates its ambition to become the global intelligence layer for household financial decisions.\n\nGiraffy is now live across the GCC and multiple European markets, with further expansion planned."

          date: "20 February 2026",
          location: "Milan, Italy",
          content: "Giraffy has officially launched in Italy, extending its European financial intelligence footprint into Southern Europe and further demonstrating the portability of its structured data model.\n\nItaly introduces a diverse regulatory and competitive environment across telecoms, banking, insurance, and consumer finance, providing another proof point for Giraffy's cross-border deployment capability.\n\n\"Every country has regulatory nuance,\" said Jason Lea, Co-founder & CEO of Giraffy. \"But the structural problem remains the same: no neutral, real-time reference layer for household finance. We are building that infrastructure across borders.\"\n\nThrough live tracking of pricing, product changes, and competitive movements, Giraffy creates a structured dataset capturing pricing shifts, launch timing, competitive positioning, and market-wide deal changes.\n\nUnlike monetised ranking platforms, Giraffy centres on structured market truth. Consumer comparison behaviour generates high-intent signals, while enterprise clients gain competitive visibility before acquisition spend begins.\n\nItaly now joins the GCC and Netherlands within Giraffy's expanding intelligence network."

          date: "16 February 2026",
          location: "Amsterdam, Netherlands",
          content: "Giraffy has officially launched in the Netherlands, marking its first major step into mainland Europe and extending its structured financial data infrastructure beyond the GCC.\n\nThe Netherlands represents one of Europe's most digitally advanced and competitive financial markets, providing a strong validation environment for Giraffy's neutral intelligence-layer model.\n\n\"Digitally mature markets still lack a unified market intelligence layer,\" said Jason Lea, Co-founder & CEO of Giraffy. \"Consumers compare across fragmented sources. Providers see internal performance data but not full competitive positioning. AI systems retrieve incomplete or biased financial information. We structure and normalise the market itself.\"\n\nGiraffy's Dutch platform tracks live pricing, offers, and provider movements across telecoms, banking, insurance, and financing. Continuous deal-level monitoring converts fragmented market activity into structured, comparable intelligence.\n\nThe Netherlands launch strengthens Giraffy's compounding data advantage through increased signal density, cross-market pricing benchmarks, historical deal memory, and competitive trend visibility.\n\nEnterprise clients access these insights via Giraffy Intelligence, the company's subscription-based market intelligence platform.\n\nThe launch reinforces Giraffy's repeatable, scalable rollout model, one that compounds across markets rather than resetting by country."

Fragmented information and limited transparency,\" said Jason Lea. \"Our expansion proves the model works beyond a single market.\""

          content: "Giraffy has officially launched in Saudi Arabia, introducing a new consumer platform designed to give people a complete and unbiased view of everyday financial products.\n\nFounded by Jason Lea after living and working in the Kingdom, Giraffy was built to solve a problem faced by millions of residents: fragmented information, unclear pricing, and limited visibility across mobile, internet, banking, insurance, and finance products.\n\nSaudi Arabia is undergoing a rapid transformation driven by Vision 2030, Open Banking, and a digital-first population. Yet despite this acceleration, consumers have lacked a single place to compare and understand their financial options.\n\nGiraffy brings full-market visibility into one platform, covering SIM cards, fibre and 5G internet, bank accounts, credit cards, loans, insurance, and more, without pay-to-play rankings or hidden exclusions.\n\n\"Living in Saudi Arabia, I experienced first hand how difficult it was to make basic financial decisions,\" said Jason Lea, Founder & CEO of Giraffy. \"Giraffy exists to show the full market clearly, so people can make better decisions with confidence.\"\n\nGiraffy's long-term vision is to become the market intelligence layer for household finance, starting in Saudi Arabia and scaling across the GCC."
